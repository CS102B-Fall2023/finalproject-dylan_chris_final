You will then present your project to the class on 12/12, where the class will choose their path within your adventure.

You will be graded on the following:
- 35% - Using at least 10 concepts learned in CS102
- 25% - Code Output
- 25% - Code Quality
- 10% - Presentation
- 5% - use of a makefile to divide the code logically

Remember that this final project represents 25% of your overall grade the for the course.

You may work as a pair for this final project, but each person of the pair must submit at least 1 commit to the project.
